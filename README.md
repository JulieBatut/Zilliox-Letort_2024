# Zilliox-Letort_2023
Cxcl12a chemokine activation distribution controls olfactory placode morpho-genesis in zebrafish embryos

#Here you will find all the elements corresponding to the figures described in the paper Zilliox, Letort et al., 2023, i.e. the different conditions of the mathematical model developed to understand the morphogenesis of the olfactory epithelium.
By figure and for each condition, you will find:
- Source codes in Python 
- Parameters used (params.py)
- Trajectories (.csv and .png) of the cells and the evolution of their convergence over time (boundinBox_time .png and .csv) along the y-axis which corresponds to the Antero-posterior axis in the embryo. The trajectory data in the "trajectories" folder
-Movies of the simulations (.mp4) in the "movie" folder
-"_pycache_" folder
